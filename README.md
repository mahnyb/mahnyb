## Hiya, Mahny here (Ë¶áµ” áµ• áµ”Ë¶)

I'm a senior Computer Science and Engineering student at Yeditepe University, passionate about exploring the intricate workings of the human mind, especially regarding language and cognition, and their intersection with technology. 

My interests span machine learning, natural language processing, neural networks, cognitive science, psycholinguistics, and linguistics. 

While I'm still gaining experience, I thrive on learning and love connecting with like-minded folks. I'm eager to engage in meaningful discussions and collaborate on exciting projects. Feel free to reach out!

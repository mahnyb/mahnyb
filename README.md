## Hi, I'm Mahny.

I'm a Computer Science and Engineering graduate from Yeditepe University with a strong interest in machine learning and artificial intelligence, especially in the context of healthcare and medicine.

I'm particularly drawn to areas like diagnostics, clinical decision support systems, and drug discovery, where intelligent systems can help solve real-world medical challenges. My long-term goal is to pursue a PhD and contribute to building trustworthy AI tools that make a real impact in healthcare.

I'm always eager to learn new things, get involved in meaningful work, and connect with others in the field. If you have any opportunitiesâ€”research, collaboration, or anything in betweenâ€”I'd love to hear about it. Feel free to reach out by sending me a message on LinkedIn.
